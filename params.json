The intention of the COREN project was to examine the possibility of applying useful image pattern recognition applications in embedded devices with the capabilities of the modern mobile phone devices, known as smart phones. The application was developed in that scope tries to recognize the identity of the coins that a user can capture by its smart phone camera. The main constraints need to be overcome for this purpose is low frequency processors and the lack of memory available in this kind of devices. The development of the application was the main concept of this research. This is the basis for experimental processes and the improvement proposals.\r\n\r\n###Implementation\r\nThe implementation of the COREN project was in Objective C for iOS devices (iPhone). The iOS version used was iOS 6.x and tested in the iPhone 4 mobile device. The COREN project was released in the Apple AppStore market for free during the year 2013. Now is not available anymore.\r\n\r\n###Links\r\n- [COREN Project Code](https://github.com/pkalodimas/COREN/archive/code.zip)\r\n- [COREN Documentation](https://github.com/pkalodimas/COREN/raw/documentation/Documentation/COREN%20-%20Project.pdf)\r\n- [SAFEMETAL Documentation](https://github.com/pkalodimas/COREN/raw/documentation/Documentation/SAFEMETAL.pdf)\r\n",
